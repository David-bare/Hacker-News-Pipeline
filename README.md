# Hacker-News-Pipeline
In this project, I will use the pipeline which I have worked on and apply it to a real-world data pipeline project. From a JSON API, I will filter, clean, aggregate, and summarize data in a sequence of tasks that will apply these transformations for me.

The data I will use comes from a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (HN) API that returns [JSON data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) of the top stories in 2014. If you're unfamiliar with Hacker News, it's a link aggregator website that users vote up stories that are interesting to the community. It is similar to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), but the community only revolves around on computer science and entrepreneurship posts.

Using this dataset, I will run a sequence of basic natural language processing tasks using the Pipeline class. 

The goal will be to find the top 100 keywords of Hacker News posts in 2014. Because Hacker News is the most popular technology social media site, this will give us an understanding of the most talked about tech topics in 2014!
